## Project Structure

In the `apps` folder of this monorepo, the two workspaces (`frontend` and `backend`) can be found.
The backend is a NestJS application, frontend is build with Angular.

## Prerequisites

1. clone project
2. run `npm install`
3. create a `.env` file on root level with the following content:

```
API_URL='http://localhost:3000'
APP_URL='http://localhost:4200'
ACCESS_SECRET='secret'
```

## Running the project

To run both, frontend and backend simultaneously, run `npm run dev`
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:4200 and the backend on http://localhost:3000/api (Swagger documentation is included here)
